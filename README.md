# FAPIAutoGen
A tool for generating a python Fast API that configures types and GET, PUT, POST, DELETE operations for all tables on a SQL Server. This tool will generate all the models so that the Fast API docs pages are generated, and users can see the expected request and responses from each table endpoint.

An example of the output is in the ./output/ folder
